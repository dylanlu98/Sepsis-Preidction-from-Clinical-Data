# Sepsis-Preidction-from-Clinical-Data

## Summary
Sepsis is a significant public health concern. According to WHO and CDC's data, nearly 1.7 million people in the U.S. develop sepsis and 270,000 people die from sepsis each year. In addition, U.S. hospitals spend more than 24 billion dollars on sepesis each year (13% U.S. healthcare expenses). Detection and treatement are critical for improving sepsis outcome. Taking advantage of the public data from https://physionet.org/content/challenge-2019/1.0.0/, which is sourced from ICU patients in three separate hospital systems, we tried to develop an automated, mechine-learning algorithm for the detection of sepsis to improve the Sepsis diagnosis.

What we have done:
1. Cleaned data and imputed missing value
2. Exploratory analysis in PCA & Umap (n = 20,336)
3. Implemented XG boost classification
4. Implemented 3-layers neuro-network
5. Implemented random forest
6. Compare model performence based on ROC curve
